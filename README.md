## Questions

The ABAP SDK is a Community SDK for IBM Watson, created by the IBM Watson development community and SAP's ABAP development community - written by ABAPers from IBM Cloud, IBM Services and IBM Systems. Therefore as a community release it is not updated with the same schedule as IBM-supported SDKs, and does not include support by IBM. For more information on IBM-supported SDKs and the update policy, please see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-using-sdks

If you have questions about the IBM Watson services or are having difficulties using the APIs, please ask a question at [dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/ask/?topics=watson) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-watson-cognitive).
